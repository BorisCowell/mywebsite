		I am a bit of a theater nerd. I do love to be on the stage. Along with this I enjoy the hit game dungeons and dragons. I do have a bit of cardboard addiction (Magic: The Gathering). Certified Goo Goo Dolls Fanboy. And no, Boris Cowell is not my real name.
		I actually wrote my <a href="\Senior Paper No Title Page.pdf">senior paper</a> on Magic: The Gathering.
